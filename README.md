## AI-Powered Cat &amp; Dog Image Generation.

## Project Description:

This project automates the extraction of cat and dog images from Instagram using Selenium and processes the data using PySpark and Machine Learning (Decision Trees). The extracted images are stored in an SQL database for metadata tracking.

A GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) is trained on the collected images to generate new, realistic cat and dog images. Users can input "cat" or "dog" to generate relevant images or request random AI-generated images. Additionally, a DALLÂ·E model is integrated for text-to-image generation.

A Flask/Streamlit web app is developed to provide a user-friendly interface for image generation and retrieval. The project can be expanded with StyleGAN2 for higher-quality image generation and deployment on cloud platforms.

This end-to-end pipeline combines Web Scraping, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, SQL, and Web Development, making it an innovative AI project with real-world applications.
